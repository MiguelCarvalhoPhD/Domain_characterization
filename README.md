# Domain_characterization
This repository contains Python code designed to analyze the presence of certain data difficulty factors such as class overlap in imbalanced classification tasks. The code leverages GPU acceleration through CuPy and RAPIDS' cuML library to perform computations efficiently. Metrics computed include F2, F3, F4, N2, N3, N4, Raug, L1, L2, L3 and IBI.
